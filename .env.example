# FortiGate Connection Configuration
# Update FGT_URL to your FortiGate management IP address or FQDN
FGT_URL=https://192.168.0.254:8443

# Session-Based Authentication (Recommended)
# Provide FortiGate administrator credentials
# This method automatically handles login, session management, and logout
FGT_USERNAME=admin
FGT_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# API Token Authentication (Alternative)
# Create an API administrator in FortiGate:
# 1. Go to System > Administrators
# 2. Create new administrator with "REST API Admin" profile
# 3. Generate API token
# 4. Paste the token below
# Note: Comment out FGT_USERNAME and FGT_PASSWORD when using token authentication
#FGT_TOKEN=your_api_token_here

# SSL/TLS Certificate Validation
# Set to 'true' to allow self-signed certificates (development/testing)
# Set to 'false' to require valid CA-signed certificates (production)
# For production, install CA-signed certificates (see README.md)
ALLOW_SELF_SIGNED=true

# Server Configuration
# Port for the dashboard web server
PORT=59169

# Production Notes:
# 1. Never commit this file with real credentials
# 2. Use strong passwords and rotate regularly
# 3. Enable proper certificate validation in production (ALLOW_SELF_SIGNED=false)
# 4. Restrict FortiGate API access to trusted hosts
# 5. Deploy dashboard behind HTTPS reverse proxy
